Week 1: Anchor Points

What have you done?

I do not have a lot of professional experience in the world of web design and development. To be honest, I wasn't sure that this was my path, until I did a mentorship program through my current job. I got to work with our IT department and assisted with the implementation and upgrade of our current website. That's what drew my initial interest in the field of web design and development. From my mentor and through the mentorship program, I learned a lot about how web pages are designed and several different coding languages, such as HTML, CSS, Java, and even JavaScript.

What are you doing?

Currently I am working full time and attending Full Sail. I'm continuously working on strengthening my coding skills and abilities, as well as learning more coding languages and programs. I've been working with my mentor and together we've been doing small projects to keep building upon the skills that I've learned from him and from my previous courses at a Full Sail. The most important thing that I do is to keep practicing my skills, because practice makes perfect.

What's next?

The next thing for me to do is to keep strengthening my skills and to do more with the skills that I currently possess. To accomplish that, I need to do more internships or freelance work. The only struggle is finding opportunities where I am geographically, because I am not in a highly developed area that offers many opportunities like in California or Washington. So until I do find those opportunities, I will continue working with my mentor and networking with the management staff of my company's IT department.
