Week 1: Call to Action - Success! - Responses

Response to Ian Smith-Mellen:

Ian, I didn't realize they turned down Mark Zuckerberg! That is a feat in itself. It goes to show that there is no such thing as small ideas and that if you follow your heart and your dreams, it will all work out in the end. It's amazing that they kept their integrity and didn't buckle even when they could have taken the easy way out. It's very inspiring and if I was in their shoes, I can't say that I would do anything different.

Response to Sean Buchholz:

Sean, before this I didn't know who Sean McCabe was and after reading this I find him to be very interesting. I've always found a simple beauty in lettering and I've always wanted to learn more about it. I think all of us suffer from trying to do too much at once and getting boggled down because of it. I know I'm guilty of that, but sometimes it's very difficult to just stop. When that happens I have to step away and take a break, before going back and refocusing my thoughts.
