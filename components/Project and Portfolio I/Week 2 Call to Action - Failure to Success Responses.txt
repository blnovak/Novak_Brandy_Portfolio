I never really thought about the background or the\'a0ingenuity of\'a0Soichiro Honda. The only real thing\'a0I knew about him was the fact that he created the Honda Motor Company.\'a0However, Soichiro Honda\'a0seems like a very realistic,\'a0yet idealistic kind of man, which is very\'a0admirable. I like that even after\'a0he was told his piston rings were not good enough by Toyota,\'a0that he was still determined to become better and never gave up. That is the true measure of success to keep moving forward despite the hardships that you face.\

Albert Einstein is one of my favorite scientists! It's admirable that he challenged the very\'a0ideas of another remarkable scientist and succeeded. His success is so prevalent that\'a0his principles and ideas\'a0are still used\'a0today. It goes to show that people can make assumptions about you,\'a0but that does not determine who you are. Albert Einstein shows that perseverance and determination despite the odds, is how you become successful and it's the legacy that you leave behind.}
