A Course for Confidence

Hello everyone! My name is Brandy Novak and I am from Akron, Ohio. I am not married, nor do I have children, but I do have a three year old beagle named Lady. I currently work in the customer service department at Signet Jewelers and have been here almost nine years. My ultimate goal is to graduate from Full Sail and either work for Google or another amazing company where I can utilize my skills and grown professionally. The only challenge I foresee is being more interactive with other people. I see this as a challenge, because I’m a relatively quiet person in real life and the only time I really talk or interact with other people is when I'm at work. The biggest challenge to my ultimate dream is finding enough time in a day to get everything accomplished, because with working fulltime, going to school full time, and taking care of my sick grandfather, I don’t have much time for anything else. My aspirations are to eventually start my own company and become my own boss.
