A Course for Confidence - Responses

Response to Kathryn Agnew:

Congratulations on the baby! Better rest up now, before all of the sleepless nights! That's amazing that you get to have firsthand experience from your parents in the industry. I'll be honest I couldn't decide if I wanted to go into mobile development or web design and development myself and I'm still wondering if I might ultimately change my major. I wish you the best towards your goals and look forward to working with you this month and in the future.

Being your own boss and having the ability to travel is something that I eventually want to do as well. I completely understand the issues with time management especially with how hectic life can be. I don't have children, but if I did I wouldn't know where to begin. I myself work in customer service; which can be unforgiving at times, but keeping my eye on the ultimate prize keeps me motivated to keep moving forward. All of this hard work will be worth it in the end!
